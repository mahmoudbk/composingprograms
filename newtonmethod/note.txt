newton is one of the invetentors of calculus if not the inventor so he gets to play with it and use it 
in order to solve other problems be it in math, physics of engineering 
what we want to do here is finding the roots of an equation or what is called the zeros of a function 
and it turned out that we can use that to approximate the square root of positive number 
so for instance if we are trying to get an approximation of the sqauare root of 3 we can turn that into a quadratic equation where sqrt(3) is a solution and we try to approximate it so algebrically that would look something like this :
x=sqrt(3) --> x^2 = 3 --> x^2-3 = 0 

As you experiment with Newton's method, be aware that it will not always converge. The initial guess of improve must be sufficiently close to the zero, and various conditions about the function must be met. Despite this shortcoming, Newton's method is a powerful general computational method for solving differentiable equations
. Very fast algorithms for logarithms and large integer division employ variants of the technique in modern computers.
