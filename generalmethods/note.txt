We can all agree that the golden ratio concept is fascinating and beautiful 
as a programmer if we think about writing some code to calculate it or at least get an approximation 
we know that the golden ratio can be represented as :
a/b = a+b/a = 1+b/a which we can get from the golden ratio multiple representation lets call it phi 
phi  = 1/phi +1 , (phi^2) = phi+1

which means that we can get a more or less good approximation if we just perform a simple for loop (in python for exp) :

guess = 1

for i in range(n):
	guess = 1/guess + 1 

where the bigger n is the better approximation we get or we can use recursion and define some functions 
to detect whether or not the approximation is close enough ..
