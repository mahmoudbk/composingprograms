we can use functions as returned values, a one simple way to explain that is through the mathematical function composition:
for instance if we have f(x) as a function and g(x) as another functions we can define h(x) their composition as follows : h(x) = f(g(x)) 

so for example if f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = x^2 
then h(2) = 5 

i demonstrate that in the code composition.py
