in python the type int respresents an exact value of an integer however its a bit tricky when it comes 
to the float type as it represents an approximation so combining multiple floats could result in 
an approximation error so for example :
>>> 7/3*3 
7.0
>>> 1/3*7*3
6.99999999999
both expressions would evaluate to 7 if not for approximation
